## The Project
The goal of this project was to implement a method of color recognition that, upon recognizing a color, would be able to play that color's associated note from a major scale. By implementing this color recognition with a line-following algorithm, we hoped to create a car that would be able to play music based on the colors it saw along a lined track. 

### What We Promised
* Line Following via a yellow line
* 3 Colors (RGB) associated with the first 3 notes of a C major scale (C4, D4, E4)
* Play associated notes through a speaker integrated with the Jetson Nano
